## Problem Statement
Cricut has announced that owners of their machines will need to purchase a monthly
subscription in order to use their hardware to its full capacity. Needless to say,
this has upset many people.

See:

* https://inspiration.cricut.com/a-letter-to-the-cricut-community-from-ashish-arora-cricut-ceo/

The goal of this project is to free those owners from the need of a monthly payment.
Requiring a subscription means that you do not own the hardware, you are merely
leasing it from Cricut. While Cricut has announced a "grandfathering" for current
owners to release them from this impingement, it does not bode well for future owners
who may believe they own their hardware.
